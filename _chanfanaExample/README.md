# Cloudflare Workers OpenAPI 3.1

This is a Cloudflare Worker with OpenAPI 3.1 using [chanfana](https://github.com/cloudflare/chanfana) and [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).

This is an example project made to be used as a quick start into building OpenAPI compliant Workers that generates the
`openapi.json` schema automatically from code and validates the incoming request to the defined parameters or request body.

## Project structure

1. Your main router is defined in `src/index.ts`.
2. Each endpoint has its own file in `src/endpoints/`.
3. For more information read the [chanfana documentation](https://chanfana.pages.dev/) and [Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/docs).
